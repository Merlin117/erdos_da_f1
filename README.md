# erdos_ds_f1
This is a repository for the F1 project of the Erdos summer 2025 Data Science bootcamp.
## Overview
### Purpose
- The purpose of this project is to create a model that will be able to predict how exciting a Formula 1 race will be.

### Interested Parties
- FIA, so they can see trends in how exciting a race is to watch and use that information to market to new audiences or make strategic changes to increase the excitment for viewers.
- F1 fans, so they can know what to expect of a race before it happens.
- People that haven't watched F1 before, so they can watch some of the more exciting races while still figuring out the nuances of the sport. 

### What is included in this Repo
Within this repo you will find the data that we used (from Kaggle.com), the scrips that we used to clean and sort our data, the plots and figures we generated, as well as the code we used to train our model.
- Raw Data (including preliminary plots and figures)
- Cleaning code (scripts and cleaned data, separated into training and test data)
- Training (model and training scripts)
- Validation (test validation)
- Final figures and plot (for presentation)
